abstract = "We present a highly scalable parallelization of a high-accuracy 3-dimensional serial multiblock Navier-Stokes solver. The code solves the full Navier-Stokes equations and it is capable of performing large-scale computations for practical configurations in industrial enviroment. The parallelization strategy is based on the geometrical domain decomposition principle, and on the overlapped communication and computation concept. The important advantage of the strategy is that the suggested type of message-passing ensures a very high scalability of the algorithm from the network point of view, because, on average, the communication work per processor is not increased if the number of processors is increased. The parallel multiblock-structured Navier-Stokes solver based on the PVM routines was implemented on 106-processors distributed memory cluster managed by the MOSIX software package. Analysis of the results demonstrated high level of parallel efficiency (speed up) of the computational algorithm. This allowed the reduction of the execution time for large-scale computations employing 10 million of grid points, from an estimated 46 days on the SGI ORIGIN 2000 computer (in the serial single-user mode) to 5-6 hours on 106-processors cluster. This means that the parallel multiblock full Navier-Stokes code can be successfully used for large-scale practical aerodynamic simulations of the complete aircraft on millions-points grids in cruise as well as take-off and landing regimes on a daily basis, as needed in industry."

This chapter discusses the multilevel parallelization strategy for optimization of aerodynamic shapes. The optimization method employs a full Navier-Stokes solver for accurate estimation of the objective function. As such it requires huge computational resources, which make efficient parallelization crucial for successful promotion of the method to an environmental engineering. The algorithm is based on a multilevel embedded parallelization approach, including parallelization of the full Navier-Stokes solver with parallel CFD (computational fluid dynamics) evaluation of objective function, parallelization of optimization process with parallel optimal search on multiple search domains, and finally, parallel grid generation. Applications (implemented on a 144-processors distributed memory cluster) include various transonic profile optimizations in the presence of nonlinear constraints. The suggested multilevel parallelization which efficiently makes use of computational power supplied by massively parallel processors (MPP), leads to a significant computational time-saving and allows the application of this method to practical aerodynamic design in the aircraft industry."

abstract = "Publisher Summary
This chapter introduces massive parallelization as principal technology for constrained optimization of aerodynamic shapes. The main goal of the aerodynamic shapes optimization is to determine a configuration that minimizes the cost function subject to various constraints imposed on the sought solution. There are two classes of constraints: aerodynamic constraints and geometrical constraints on the shape. Massive parallelization is a crucial element of any successful optimization of aerodynamic shapes in engineering environment. This chapter discusses implementation of massive parellization technology in the framework of a new efficient optimization tool (the code OPTIMAS—OPTIMization of Aerodynamic Shapes). The optimization method employs genetic algorithms (GAs) in combination with a reduced-order models (ROM) method, based on linked local databases obtained by full Navier–Stokes computations. The algorithm is built upon a multilevel embedded parallelization strategy, which efficiently makes use of computational power supplied by massively parallel processors. Applications (implemented on a 456-processors distributed memory cluster) include various 3D optimizations in the presence of nonlinear constraints. The results demonstrate that the approach combines high accuracy of optimization with high parallel efficiency and thus allows application of the method to practical aerodynamic design in the aircraft industry."
