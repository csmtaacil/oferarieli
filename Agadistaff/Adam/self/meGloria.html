I was born in Israel in 1986 and grew up in Kiryat-Ono (a small suburb of Tel-Aviv).
During high-school I started studying for a B.Sc in math at
		<a href='https://math.biu.ac.il/'>Bar-Ilan University.</a>
During my military service I continued for a master's and Ph.D at the same department.
I did both degrees under the supervision of 
<a href='http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~vishne/'>Uzi Vishne,</a>
on division algebras.

My first postdoctoral experience was a one-year stay (funded by Wallonie-Bruxelles-International) at UCLouvain, 
under the mentorship of <a href='https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-pierre.tignol/Page_personnelle_de_Jean-Pierre_Tignol.html'>Jean-Pierre Tignol,</a>
and later I took a two-year research-scholar position at 
<a href='https://math.msu.edu/'>Michigan State University,</a>
where I was working primarily with Rajesh Kulkarni and his PhD students.

<p>
My first faculty position in Israel was in the Computer Science department at 
 <a href='http://english.telhai.ac.il/academic/computer-science-b-sc/'>Tel-Hai College,</a> where I served both as a senior lecturer and the math division head.
As of October 2020, I am a faculty member in the school of Computer Science at Tel-Aviv-Yaffo Academic College.
