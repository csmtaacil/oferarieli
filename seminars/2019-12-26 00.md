evtTitle: Distributed Computing with Rational Agents
evtAbstract: |
    In recent years, there is a growing interest in distributed algorithms for networks in which the participants are not faulty but rational,
    and may deviate from the prescribed algorithm in order to increase their profit.
    Until now, these distributed algorithms for rational agents have assumed a-priori knowledge of the size of the network.

    We generalize the game-theoretic model of distributed computing and present basic building blocks that are in equilibrium, i.e., where no agent can profit by cheating.
    We then challenge this assumption by proving that, without a-priori knowledge of the network size,
    there is no equilibrium for many different distributed computing problems.
