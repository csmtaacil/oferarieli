evtTitle: "Vertex Sparsifiers of Planar Graphs"
evtAbstract: |
    These days, more than ever, we deal with huge graphs such as social networks,
    communication networks, roadmaps and so forth.
    But even when our main interest is only in a small portion of the input graph G,
    we still need to process all or most of it in order to answer our query,
    since the runtime and memory requirements of many 
    common graph algorithms depend on the input (graph) size.
    Therefore, a natural question is whether we can find a vertex sparsifier H,
    which is a smaller graph that exactly (or approximately) preserves 
    some properties of the original graph such as distances, cuts and flows.
    This talk presents the state of the art results of vertex sparsifiers
    for planar graphs, and further refines these bounds by a topological 
    parameter called the terminal face cover.
