\maketitle
The maintainer of the site (aka, the webmaster) should have working knowledeg of
	{\bf github pages}, {\bf Jekyll} and {\bf Node.JS}.
There are three accounts used by the webmaster:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
	{\bf webmaster@cs.mta.ac.il}.
	The webmaster email.
	It is used only for communications.
	No information is stored in this account.
	This address is ultimately controlled by the college, which is either good thing or bad thing,
		depending on your tastes.
\item
	{\bf csmtaacil@hotmail.com}.
	This is the site development account.
	All material is to be found on the {\bf onedrive} of this account.
	This account uses two-factor authentication with the webmaster's phone.
\item
	{\bf github account csmtaacil@hotmail.com}.
	This is the github pages account.
	All the material can be found also here in the git repository.
	This account uses two-factor authentication with the webmaster's phone.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to the automation supplied by Jekyll we use two (simple) Node.JS programs in order
to support  Hebrew/English pages and translation of bib fiiles to yaml files.
A third program is used to remove the files generated by the previous two programs.
The three programs are in the {\bf \textunderscore apply} directory and should be executed
	from within there.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf hello.js}.
	This program scans for file names of the form `\textunderscore *.md' and generates
		from them md files with language and/or menu suffixes.
\item
	{\bf parse.js}.
	This program scans for file names of the form `\textunderscore *.bib' and generates
		from them md files with yaml headers replacing the bib syntax.
		All kinds of conversion from latex syntax to html are done also.
		The conversion list is not full.
\item
	{\bf clean.js}.
	This program removes the files generated by previous two programs.
\end{enumerate}
The passwords of the accounts are known to the webmaster and the steering committee.
In case the webmaster ceases to exist, switching of the phone number to the replacing 
	webmaster phone will require the cooperation of the current webmaster family.
	(This is a good thing.)
